# Manual-for-Future-Balloon-Teams
We are developing a manual that puts together all projects we've done in the past few years (Fall 2023 to Spring 2025) so that future balloon teams can build on top of them with little to no effort. This includes a realtime remote-controlled balloon cutdown system, a multi-sensor weather balloon system, a realtime sensor data communication system, a realtime image recognition and captioning system, several scientific experiments done on the balloon, and the inovations we've made on the mechanical design of the payload. We are also including projects done prior to the F23 team (those of which we can recreate from oral knowledge and the balloon github repos). This includes a ground control website that displays balloon sensor data in realtime and possibly, a data analysis program for data collected from the balloon. We hope that future balloon teams can continue to add to this manual for the benefit of future generations of balloon team!
